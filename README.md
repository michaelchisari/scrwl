Before we begin, let's talk about what Scrwl is and is not.

Scrwl is NOT for compilation.
-----

Scrwl is NOT for documentation.
-----

Scrwl is for conversation.
-----
Scrwl is shorthand for code. It's independent of any language or paradigm. It exists only to facilitate conversation, note-taking and idea-scribbling.

What's a use case? A group of developers are talking in front of a white board. They want to discuss an algorithm without writing out things like _"function() {"_ or _"for (var i=0; i<max; i++) {"_ and so forth to illustrate it. They can use Scrwl to map out the flow and logic of an algorithm on the white board. It's a simple shorthand, it's easy to learn and intuitive, so small cheat sheets are all that is necessary for new participants.

Another use case? Developers are talking, and someone wants to take notes for later.  Scrwl, like all shorthands, allow them to write down the ideas discussed quickly.

One more use case? Sometimes, far away from a computer or long after bedtime, an idea comes.  Scrwl allows the basic idea and flow to be written out on paper.  The idea can then be used later for building the software using a proper programming language.

Scrwl is for efficiency.

Each character in Scrwl maxes out at two strokes. Characters can be combined to express different ideas. Each character is designed to be intuitive and easily recognize or remembered.
